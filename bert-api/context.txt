FlickFinder is a web application for discovering movies and TV shows. You can search for ratings using our intuitive search bar, which allows you to input your preferences or mood. The navbar includes two buttons: one to toggle the sidebar on the left and another on the right side where you can view your profile if you decide to create an account.

By creating an account, you will have the ability to save your favorite series and movies, as well as save your chats with the chatbot. To access the chatbot in the left sidebar, simply click the button to toggle the chat bar. The application provides a list of relevant movies and TV shows based on your search. Filters include release year, movie duration, and rating, allowing you to refine your search results.

The "Add to Watchlist" button lets you save your favorite movies for easy access later. FlickFinder helps you organize and find movies and TV shows of interest effortlessly.
